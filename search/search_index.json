Input Data \u00b6 The input file should contain a list of genes as HGNC symbols, separated by a newline character. Genes in non-standard formats will not be analyzed. The example input file located in the following location: inputs/genes.txt The example input file contains the following contents and can be found here : > cat inputs/genes.txt CCR5 ALCAM Running gNALI \u00b6 gNALI only requires an input file, and has other optional parameters. We will use an input file with the path inputs/genes.txt and query gnomADv2.1.1. Since gnomADv2.1.1 is the default database, we do not have to specify it with the -d / --database parameter. To see what predefined filters are available with this database, we can use the help command (more info here ). Available additional filters can be found here . Next, we will filter the variants keeping only those with a non-zero number of homozygous control samples (available as a predefined filter) and alternate allele count greater than 2 (by specifying an additional filter). We will also generate a VCF file for variants passing filtering, generate population frequencies, and write our results to a directory called output-advanced . Here is what such a command would look like: gnali --input inputs/genes.txt --predefined_filters homozygous-controls --additional_filters \"AC>2\" --vcf --pop_freqs --output output-advanced/ Output \u00b6 By default, gNALI will have two output files in output-advanced/ : a basic output file, and a detailed output file. When using the -v / --vcf flag, a third additional output file will be generated. More information on outputs can be found here . Output files for this example can be found here . Basic Output \u00b6 The basic output file contains a subset of the input genes, the ones that have high-confidence loss-of-function variants that pass filtering. It also contains a list of genes that could not be found in the specified database, if any.

There is currently no way to disable this. Other filters are available through optional parameters. Predefined Filters \u00b6 gNALI defines a few filters natively. We can view them using the help command. > gnali --help ... -p [PREDEFINED_FILTERS [PREDEFINED_FILTERS ...]], --predefined_filters [PREDEFINED_FILTERS [PREDEFINED_FILTERS ...]] Predefined filters. To use multiple, separate them by spaces. Options: {'gnomadv2.1.1': {'homozygous- controls': 'controls_nhomalt>0', 'heterozygous- controls': 'controls_nhomalt=0', 'homozygous': 'nhomalt>0'}, 'gnomadv3.1.1': {'homozygous': 'nhomalt>0'}} ... gnomADv2.1.1 Filters \u00b6 We can see we have three predefined filters (and the filter expressions they use) for gnomADv2.1.1 available: homozygous-controls will filter for variants with a non-zero number of homozygous samples in the control group heterozygous-controls will filter for variants with a non-zero number of heterozygous samples in the control group homozygous will filter for variants with a non-zero number of homozygous samples gnomADv3.1.1 Filters \u00b6 We can see we have one predefined filters (and the filter expression it usse) for gnomADv3.1.1 available: homozygous will filter for variants with a non-zero number of homozygous samples For example, if we were using gnomADv2.1.1 and wanted to filter for variants with a non-zero number of homozygous samples in the control group, we could use the following command: gnali --input my_gnali_stuff/data/genes.txt --predefined_filters homozygous-controls --output my_results/ To use several predefined filters, separate them with spaces in your command. An example execution using predefined filters can be found here . Additional Filters \u00b6 To filter based on an annotation, construct an expression of the form <annotation><operator><value>, where annotation appears in the below available filters or in the VCF header of your database, operator is one of != / == / < / > / <= / >= , and value is a value to compare to, subject to the value type (ex. integer, floating point, string, etc). Enclose them in quotes and separate by spaces if you're using several additional filters at once. For example, if we were using gnomADv2.1.1 and wanted to filter for variants with an alternate allele count greater than 3, and total allele number greater than 10, we would find the following annotations below : Annotation Value Type Description AC Integer Alternate allele count for samples AN Integer Total number of alleles in samples ... and add the expressions \"AC>3\" and \"AN>10\" to our command, like so: gnali --input my_gnali_stuff/data/genes.txt --additional_filters \"AC>3\" \"AN>10\" --output my_results/ An example execution using additional filters can be found here .

system. gNALI may either be installed directly or as a Bioconda package. gNALI may either be run on a single machine or a computing cluster. Bioconda \u00b6 The simpliest and recommended way to install gNALI is using the Bioconda channel for the conda package management system. We recommend installing conda with the Miniconda package. Note that the choice of Miniconda only affects the Python version in root environment. We recommend installing Miniconda using Python 3.8 64-bit Linux installer . Overview \u00b6 The Bioconda-based gNALI installation involves the following: Installing Bioconda Installing the \"gNALI\" Bioconda package ( conda install gnali ). We provide detailed instructions below. Miniconda (Python 3.8) \u00b6 Bioconda requires conda to be installed and we recommend using the Miniconda package. Miniconda may be installed with the follow instructions: wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod 755 Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh You will likely want Miniconda to append the install location to your PATH and will need to select this option during the installation process. After installation, you will then need to either open a new terminal or source your bashrc file in the current terminal for Miniconda to become available on the PATH: source ~/.bashrc You can check if your Miniconda installation was successful with the following: conda --version Bioconda \u00b6 You will need to add the following channels to conda. They must be added in this order so that priority is set correctly. conda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --add channels defaults conda config --add channels anaconda conda config --add channels bioconda gNALI (Miniconda 3.8) \u00b6 The follwing instructions assume you are using the Python 3.8 version of Miniconda. In this circumstance, we need to install gNALI within a Python 3.7 environment: conda create --name gnali-env python=3.7 gNALI This gNALI environment can be activated with the following: conda activate gnali-env You can check if gNALI was installed correctly with the following: gnali --version After installing, optionally run the command gnali_get_data <reference genome> to download reference files required to add loss-of-function annotations. * For use with gnomADv2.1.1 or gnomADv3.1.1, you do not have to run gnali_get_data * For use with custom databases WITH loss-of-function annotations, you do not have to run gnali_get_data * For use with custom databases WITHOUT loss-of-function annotations, run gnali_get_data grch37 or gnali_get_data grch38 depending on the reference genome used The files downloaded by gnali_get_data for each reference genome require abut 35GB of disk space and took 1.5 hours on our systems with 16GB of RAM and a 3.20GHz processor. The current environment may be deactivated with the following: conda deactivate It is important to note that this gNALI Bioconda environment will need to be activated in order to run the gNALI application. However, the benefit is that your system will be shielded from the Python 3.7 installation required by gNALI. GitHub \u00b6 The following instructions describe how to install gNALI using GitHub.

Input Data \u00b6 The input file should contain a list of genes as HGNC symbols, separated by a newline character. Genes in non-standard formats will not be analyzed. The example input file located in the following location: inputs/genes.txt The example input file contains the following contents and can be found here : > cat inputs/genes.txt CCR5 ALCAM Running gNALI \u00b6 gNALI only requires an input file, and has other optional parameters. We will use an input file with the path inputs/genes.txt , filter for high-confidence loss-of-function variants, and write our results to a directory called output-simple . Since we have not selected a database to use, gNALI will default to gnomADv2.1.1. Here is what such a command would look like: gnali --input inputs/genes.txt --output output-simple/ Output \u00b6 By default, gNALI will have two output files in output-simple/ : a basic output file, and a detailed output file. When using the -v / --vcf flag, a third additional output file will be generated. An example of such output can be found in the advanced walkthrough . More information on outputs can be found here . Output files for this example can be found here . Basic Output \u00b6 The basic output file contains a subset of the input genes, the ones that have high-confidence loss-of-function variants that pass filtering. It also contains a list of genes that could not be found in the specified database, if any. The file shown below can also be found here . output-simple/Nonessential_Host_Genes_\\(Basic\\).txt: HGNC_Symbol Status CCR5 HC LoF found ALCAM HC LoF found Detailed Output \u00b6 The detailed output file contains the high-confidence loss-of-function variants that pass filtering with some annotations extracted.

# gNALI #

gNALI (**g**ene **n**onessentiality **a**nd **l**oss-of-function **i**dentifier) is a tool to find and filter (high-confidence) 
potential loss-of-function variants of human genes. gNALI has built-in support for [gnomADv2.1.1 and gnomadv3](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) 
and can be configured to be used with other VCF databases.

NOTE: loss-of-function is influenced by the genome build. Not all variants available in gnomADv2.1.1 are
available in gnomADv3 and vice versa.

## Release ##

**gNALI 1.0.1**

This release fixes population frequency output column order.
